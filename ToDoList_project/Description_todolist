✅ To-Do List – Terminal C Project
This was probably the most ambitious of the three — a full-featured terminal-based task manager written entirely in C.
I wanted it to feel like a real productivity tool, even though it ran inside the command line. And I think I pulled it off!


It lets you:

📝 Add tasks with description, deadline, priority, and category

🗂️ Categorize tasks (Work, Study, Personal, Other)

🗓️ Sort automatically by deadline (earliest first)

✅ Mark tasks as completed

🔎 View tasks filtered by category

💾 Save/load tasks from a binary file (tasks.dat)

🎨 Enjoy color-coded output for easy readability (priority, category, status)

The interface is clean, responsive, and functional — using just stdio.h, time.h, and a bit of Windows API for colored output.


📌 What I learned
This project helped me dive deeper into:

Real-time date comparisons and deadline calculations

Sorting algorithms (qsort)

Structs and dynamic input handling

Designing user-friendly CLI menus with a touch of style


🛠️ Developed entirely in Code::Blocks on Windows.
