🗂️ Student Record Management System – C Project
It’s a small terminal-based tool I made in C to manage basic student records — sort of like a mini database system but all local.

You can:

➕ Add new students (first name, last name, and roll number like AM12345)

🔍 View all student records in a neat table

🧭 Search by roll number or surname

❌ Delete a student by roll number

📤 Export all data to a .csv file for Excel or Google Sheets

💾 All data is saved in a local binary file (students.dat), so everything stays intact even after you close the program.


📌 What I learned
This was my hands-on intro to:

File I/O (saving and loading structs to/from files)

Working with arrays of structs in C

Implementing a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system

It might look small, but it taught me how real software keeps data persistent — and how the terminal can still be a powerful tool when you make it interactive.


🛠️ Built using Code::Blocks on Windows with gcc.
